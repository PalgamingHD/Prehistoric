# Prehistoric
An attempt to bring Dinosaurs and Fossils to Fabric 1.16.4

<p>This mod is a rewrite of the mod "Fossil's and Archeology" and many textures have been used from the project(allowed through their license). Although I am hoping to add a lot of my own stuff into there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tutorial (So far):<br /><br /></h2>
<p>First, go to Diamond level, and find Fossils (Which generate naturally)&nbsp;<img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/461619440115646464/791022806254223380/2020-12-22_13.15.38.png?width=1191&amp;height=670" alt="" width="413" height="232" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These will have a random chance of dropping items, one of which is the Relic Scrap and the Fossil. (You may also obtain Fossils from putting sand or gravel in the Sifter)<br /><br />Putting relic scraps within the Analyzer gives you a variety of items including the Ancient Sword and Ancient Helmet.<br />Hitting a passive animal with the ancient sword, has the chance of summoning a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scarabs are also found as a rare drop from the fossil block, when combined with a gold pickaxe it creates a tool better than diamond and gold but worse than Netherite.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE: This mod is far from being complete, so far there are fossils, Scarab Tools, and the Ancient Helmet and Sword as well as the Archeology Workbench, Sifter, and Analyzer as well as most of their respective uses.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If anyone would like to help me with this project that would be awesome, there is a lot of finish and my coding sucks.</strong></p>
